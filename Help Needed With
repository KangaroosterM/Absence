I will need help eventually with "looping"/"repeating" the part of the game where the player has to choose where they came from.  If anyone out there feels like adding that to the code or simply inserting it then let me know.
Other than that, tips would be appreciated as far as cleaning up the code and maybe changing things to make the player's experience in the game better.
